Now that we've created a cluster, we can monitor the status in the [SageMaker console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home), this will show us cluster status, running instances, node groups, and allow us to easy modify the cluster.

1. Go to [SageMaker HyperPod](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?/cluster-management) console.

2. You'll see your cluster listed, click on it:

Wait until your cluster status changes to **InService** before proceeding. This should take ~10 minutes.
