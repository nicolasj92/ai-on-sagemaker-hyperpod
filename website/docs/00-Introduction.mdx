## Train, fine tune, and host generative AI models on Amazon Sagemaker Hyperpod

Welcome to the **AI on Sagemaker Hyperpod**, your home for deploying large distributed training clusters on [Amazon Sagemaker Hyperpod](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/hyperpod/).

### What can you find here
This is the home for all things related to Amazon Sagemaker Hyperpod, built by the ML Frameworks team at AWS with support from the open source community. We strive to deliver content and assets based on real-world use cases and customer feedback.

Explore practical examples, architectural patterns, troubleshooting, and many other contents. Work through running large distributed training jobs, fine tuning, distillation, and preference alignment, using frameworks such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html), [NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/), [Ray](https://www.ray.io/#use-cases), etc. We provide examples for [Meta's Llama](https://www.llama.com/), [Amazon Nova](https://nova.amazon.com/), [Mistral](https://mistral.ai/), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/en), and others.

There is troubleshooting advise on specific problems you may find, best practices when integrating with other AWS services and open source projects, and code snippets that you may find useful to incorporate on your workloads.

> **Note:** AI On Sagemaker Hyperpod is an active development. For upcoming features and enhancements, please check out the [issues](https://github.com/awslabs/ai-on-sagemaker-hyperpod/issues) section.

## Getting Started
Before delighting yourself with the features and examples provided here, we suggest you work through the setup of your Sagemaker Hyperpod cluster. On that initial step, we provide examples on how to do it using different methods (GUI, CLI scripts, Infrastructure as a Code - IaC, etc). After deploying your cluster, we recommend running a few basic tests to validate you have a working cluster running as expected.

Then you can select which of the scenarios you want to work on. On every scenario we have two possible orchestration choices: using SLURM or EKS. You should select the specific example you want to go through and the specific orchestration engine you are using on your cluster. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with SageMaker HyperPod, configure your environment with the required tools.

<details>
<summary>Install the AWS CLI</summary>

:::note
The AWS CLI comes pre-installed on AWS CloudShell.

<summary>Configure AWS Credentials</summary>

Please refer to [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html) to understand the different ways to acquire AWS Credentials to use AWS CLI.

For simplicity and to demonstrate the process of configuring AWS credentials for the CLI, we are going to use long-term access keys for designated IAM Users.

:::caution Important
To maintain a proper security posture we recommend either using short-term credentials or setting up AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) for short-term credentials.
:::

**1. Acquire AWS access long-term credentials**

Please visit [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html#cli-authentication-user-get) to learn how to acquire these credentials from the AWS console.

**2. Configure AWS CLI**

Using the credentials you fetched above, use `aws configure` to add the credentials to your terminal. See [configure aws credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html#cli-authentication-user-configure.title) for more details.

```bash
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: us-west-2
Default output format [None]: json
```

**3. Set AWS Region**

Next you can set the environment variable for `AWS_REGION` to ensure it points to the region where you intend to stand up your infrastructure. AWS CLI provides command line arguments as [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html) to override certain variables.

```bash
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

For more information on the aws configure cli command please refer to this [CLI reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/)
