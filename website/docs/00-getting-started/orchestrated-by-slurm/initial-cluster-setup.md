SageMaker HyperPod now provides a new cluster creation experience that sets up all the resources needed for large-scale AI/ML workloads, including, networking, storage, compute, and IAM permissions in just a few clicks. The new cluster creation experience for SageMaker HyperPod introduces dual quick and custom setup paths that simplify getting started for both beginners and advanced AWS customers.  

- With the **new quick** setup path, you can now launch a fully-operational cluster optimized for large-scale AI workloads directly from the AWS console using a streamlined single-page interface that provisions all dependencies including VPCs, subnets, FSx storage, EKS orchestrator, and essential configurations required for building and deploying models. 

- The **custom setup** path empowers platform engineering teams already familiar with AWS to fine-tune every setting, from specific subnet configurations to selective installations, all within the same unified console experience, along with the ability to export auto-generated CloudFormation templates for production deployment.

To get started, navigate to the [SageMaker AI console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?#/cluster-management) and follow the instructions at:
